 **Genome Assembly** (https://officialprofile.github.io/Genome-assembly/). 
 
This mini textbook describes (or perhaps one should say "will describe") selected algorithms that play a vital role in the *de novo* genome assembly or in some related areas.

The premise of this book is to construct these algorithms from the very bottom along with brief explanation of their gists. Naturally, the applications are included as well.

By default the code is written in R, but python and shell can appear at some point as well.

It is assumed that the reader

1. has a basic understanding of genetics,
2. has some experience with programming in R,
3. had some contact with higher mathematics, e.g. probability, statistics, graph theory. 

Reader should also be familiar with the pipe %>% syntax.
