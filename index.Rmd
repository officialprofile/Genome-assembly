# Introduction

This mini textbook describes (or perhaps one should say "will describe") selected algorithms that play key role in the *de novo* genome assembly. Some algorithms that are being used in a bit different areas are also presented, e.g. Burrows-Wheeler transform.

The premise of this work is to construct this algorithms from the very bottom. By default the code is in R, but python and shell can also somewhere appear.
